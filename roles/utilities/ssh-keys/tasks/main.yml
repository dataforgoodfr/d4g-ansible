# /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file is automatically generated on Scaleway
# It gets regenerated regularly based on the information available on our admin panel : https://console.scaleway.com/project/ssh-keys
# The problem is that it's not generated for all projects at once, which makes it difficult to track/update
# We handle this problem in terraform, and we run the fetch-keys utility periodically on all machines.
